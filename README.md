# FileShare
This is the site repo hosted for [FileShare App!](http://sobydamn.github.io/fileshare).
<br/>

## About
I had created this app as it was really hard to pick between multiple filesharing apps available which most of them requires sender and receiver both having the same app. More can be found [here!](https://sobydamn.blogspot.com/2020/05/fileshare-app.html)<br>
FileShare App provides a way to share file where only the sender needs to have the app and the receiver can use any web browser(from PC or phone) to receive the files.
Files are shared over http on local network or _hotspot_ using ServerSocket connection but internet connection is required to load the site and the ServiceWorker.
>Currently available for Android platform.
## How to use
1. [Download](http://sobydamn.github.io/fileshare) the App on your device
2. Turn the Hotspot service on.
_Create password protected hotspot in case you want share files securely._
3. Select the files which you want to send to the receiver.
4. Send Receiver connected to your hotspot at the [Receiving Address](http://sobydamn.github.io/fileshare) as shown in the app and receive the files.
